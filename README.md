# Aerospace
space and aeronautics codes used in aerospace engineering assignments

- AstrodynamicsInterface_Estrellante.py
  Application of concepts on the astrodynamics assignature in the realization of a interface similar to STK or GMAT. this version only has a initial interface with tkinter and the N-body problem simulation with a SQL database of planets and moons

- Interestellar.ipynb
  Application of concepts on the astrodynamics assignature in the realization of a program capable of calculate the trajectories between sun and other stars. The example is Alpha Centauri

- Matching chart
  Application of concepts on the aerospace design assignature to realize the matching chart proccess for a coast MALE UAV design.
